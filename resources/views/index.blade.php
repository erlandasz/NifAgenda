            Back for its 3rd annual edition, the global-pharma industry forum addresses through its conference programme the main challenges for 2020 in investment, partnering and alliance management. The program will cover BioPartnering for CNS, with industry keynotes and panels on AD, PD, Neuropsychiatry and Pain Management. Moreover, there are panels on innovation in neurotech covering banking, device, diagnostics and software.
